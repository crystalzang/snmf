# itrSNMF

## Objective
In this repository, we develop a program to estimate individualized treatment rule (ITR) by
leveraging both structured quantitative data and high-dimensional unstructured textual documents. 
To tackle the challenge of incorporating text data, we propose an outcome-driven supervised nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF) method that extracts relevant topics for ITR estimation in a one-step procedure.
